# Things I Learned 

## How this project works 
- In the HTML there are three seperate divs inside the main container with the id's: start-screen, quiz-screen, and result-screen. Ultimately these screens are the driver of this project. All 3 of these div's have the class "screen," however only the start-screen has the class "active." When a screen has the class active it is displayed in the browser because of the following line of CSS: `display: block;` and when the screen doesn't have the class of active it is hiden using the CSS: `display: none;`
- The flow of the application is as follows: when the application is launched the start screen is displayed by the default, users have a button that says start quiz. We keep track of when the user clicks the button using the following JS: `addEventListener("click", startQuiz)`. When the function startQuiz executes that main thing it does is it removes the active class from the start screen and adds the active class to the quiz screen. This achieved by the following JS: `startScreen.classList.remove("active")` and `quizScreen.classList.add("active")`. We know the user reaches the end of the quiz when the current question index reaches the length of the questions array, and when that happens we call a function called showResults. Show results is responsible for removing the active class from the quiz screen and adding the active screen to the result screen. Lastly, if the user hits the restart quiz button on the restart screen then the active class is removed from the result screen and then immediately after the startQuiz function is called which will take care of everything from the start.
